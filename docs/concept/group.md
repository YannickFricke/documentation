# Group
Suppose you have many paths with the same prefix.
- /user/sign-in
- /user/sign-up
- /user/profile

Instead of writing many same prefixes, you can group them.

---
Grouping allows you to combine multiple prefixes into one.
```typescript
app.group('/user', app => app
    .post('/sign-in', signIn)
    .post('/sign-up', signUp)
    .post('/profile', getProfile)
)
```

You can create as many nested groups as you like:
```typescript
app.group('/v1', app => app
    .get('/', () => 'Using v1')
    .group('/user', app => app
        .post('/sign-in', signIn)
        .post('/sign-up', signUp)
        .post('/profile', getProfile)
    )
)
```

## Plugin group
You can separate group into an instance and register the group as plugin for code separation and reduce nesting.
```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const users = new Elysia({ prefix: '/user' })
    .post('/sign-in, signIn)
    .post('/sign-up', signUp)
    .post('/profile', getProfile)

app.group('/v1', app => app
    .get('/', () => 'Using v1')
    .use(users)
)
```
